                  resources to help better care for and raise their children. They work alongside

                  or locate services such as in-home nursing care. They often play a critical role in 
                  supporting clients as they navigate the numerous healthcare and public service systems that

    <h1>social worker skills</h1>
    <p>Each social worker employs a diverse set of skills to do their work. But as we discussed earlier, there are certain skills that can be particularly useful to those in the field. Below are some examples:

        Empathy. This skill enables the social worker to put themselves in their client’s shoes. Having empathy can offer a social worker a deeper understanding of their client’s problems.  
        Organization. With the many daily responsibilities they have, social workers need to be extremely organized. The amount of paperwork and caseloads can add up from networking, calls, billing, and organizing services for everyone. 
        Communication. Social workers should be clear, concise, and transparent with clients and their families or care providers, and colleagues. Strong communication can help to mitigate misunderstandings and break down other communication barriers.
        Problem-Solving. No case is the same and a social worker is often working hard to find the best solution in a difficult situation. A good problem solver can help clients obtain the best services and support needed.
        Patience. As a social worker, you will work with diverse clients. Maintaining patience and understanding clients from different racial and socio-economic backgrounds is a core component of social work practice. </p>

        <h3>Child Development</h3>
        <p>Often social worker will need to make well- informed judgements about the child's situation; balancing the child's needs to safety and well- being with that of the needs of the family which may be in a vulnerable situation itself. Implementing is at the core of the intervention programme.</p>

        <h3>Psychological Development</h3>
        <p>Social workers enjoy connecting individuals or families in need with resources and services that improve their circumstances and help them achieve social equity. Psychologists study the human mind and the normal and abnormal behaviors that the brain can produce.</p>
